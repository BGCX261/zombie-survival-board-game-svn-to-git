#summary 2nd Email from Byrnie

Um, might not be a great idea, but how about giving them a set of six cards for movement?  could use tokens I guess, but six cards of the player colour would mean that there wouldn't be any arguments about how many actions people have left etc...

6 sounds like a good initial number for playtesting.

Hm, true.  It would add a further tradeoff for low clip weapons, which we maybe don't need.

Priorities I think is the easiest way.  I think you might be right - Pipebomb may well trump vomit.  That way its simple to determine what moves where which makes the enemy quick to run and quite predictable (which is good, given they're zombies...)

Like the director plan, sounds like a good initial stab at balance.  I assume that cards that give items will generally have more zombies then those that don't?

I think spawn limits are best set by having none initially and then scaling back a little whenever "ooh, that's harsh" is uttered ;)

If they all move or not - depends how frantic you want the game really... if they do they'll have to be weaker...

Oh, hang on - idea.  How about having damage done to zombies knocked off their MP?  that way you could keep them back even if you only have a hand full of low damage cards...
