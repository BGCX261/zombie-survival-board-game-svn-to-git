#summary Notes on design of Director Deck

= Introduction =
Current design on this page supports V0.2 of the Ruleset


= Details =

Card is drawn when;
 * New Tile is placed
 * Just before Zombie Spawning/Movement

Notes on the card detail the number of zombies to spawn, and how many to move (spawning position and movement is only relevant for the "before Zombie Spawning/Movement draw")

The card will have slightly differing spawn rules based on the [PlayerState player state], to allow for in-game balancing.
