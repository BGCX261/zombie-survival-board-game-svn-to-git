#summary Spending XP to improve Equipment

_(for the record, I don't like this idea, and would prefer to include this as Player Upgrades)_

Players may spend XP to improve the abilities of any weapon they carry
 # Improved Rate of Fire (attack cards playable per turn)
 # Improved Clip-Size (more cards in hand)
 # Improved Damage (+_x_ damage per card played)
 # Improved Range

Non-weapon improvements
 # Healthpacks heal more
 # Explosives have bigger blast/can be thrown further
 # Pills last longer
