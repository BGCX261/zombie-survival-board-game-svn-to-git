#summary Spending XP to benefit the entire team

There are 2 ways that teams can spend XP to support everyone;
 # Upgrading [TileDeck Tile Deck] cards
 # Upgrading Weapon Spawns from basic to advanced weapons

For these all players must spend the cost from their own XP (so if the players wish to upgrade a [TileDeck Tile Deck] card, they must all spend _x_ XP points).
