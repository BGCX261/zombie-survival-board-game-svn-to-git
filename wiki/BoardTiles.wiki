Issues determined;
 # Hard to cut out (jagged sides)

New features;
 # Smoother sides and "half-hexes"
 # Pre-determined walls
 # Arrows to support on-the-fly board placement and routing
 # Larger hexes
 # Actual graphics

Issues Determined;
 # Need to add random location hexes for zombie/item spawning
 # When printing, the background texture comes out too dark. Need a higher contrast.
