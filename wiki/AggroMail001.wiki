#summary First email from Aggro to me

Interesting, just spent a while looking at it. I think I can see what you're going for - looks pretty cool. Are you planning to get it out for a playtest while we're over for TI, or do you think TI is long enough that we should just get on with it?

I like the thinking about players playing their own game in a cooperative way... the groupthink problem is a common issue in co-op games.

How about some form of time-limit for turns? If players are pushed for time, they might not have time to talk things though, although I geuss that wouldn't stop the players whose turn it isn't from conferring.

OK... how about a rule of "don't talk tactics"? Hard to enforce, but in a co-op game a "best effort" might be enough. You could allow players to spend movement points or somesuch to talk tactics for a certain amount of time to model characters breaking focus on running & shooting in order to communicate. That might be hard to guage; how much time? Are other players alowed to respond or do they have to spend their own movement (my gut feel would be give up moves from their next turn)? Obviously that would only be to talk about strategy; normal table-banter would be unaffected. A bit of a weird feeling rule, and I'm not sure if it would work, but it might be worth a try...

Anyway. I could keep going here, but you've already gone home, and now I'm going to.
