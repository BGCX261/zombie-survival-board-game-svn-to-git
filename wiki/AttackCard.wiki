#summary Details of the composition of the Attack Deck, and considerations on size
<wiki:toc max_depth="4" />
=Attack Deck=
==Composition==
The basic structure of the deck should be of a fairly small number of cards

 * 1-Hit Card (1 in 6)
 * 2-Hit Card (2 in 6)
 * 3-Hit Card (1 in 6)
 * 3-Hit Card (friendly fire) (1 in 6)
 * MISS (1 in 6)

Basically it is a dice-based structure. Cards will be used in 2 circumstances
 * Adding into Suppression Fire
 * Individually killing zombies

When individually killing zombies the value does not matter (unless it is a MISS card). The card value is used in Suppression Checks.

==Volume==

The party will share a combined Ammo Deck, which will consist of a number of Ammo Cards in the above composition. The volume of cards should be enough to equip all 4 players (both weapons) at least twice, ideally more.

With the V0.3 current ruleset the largest total in-hand deck size is 14 (Uzi at 10 + Pistol at 4). 
4 players @ 14 cards = 56
So approximately 110 cards (which is 2 normal decks)

==Deck Cycling==
Cards are drawn into the hand from the shared ammo deck when;
 # New weapon picked up as Item
 # Player Reloads

Cards can be discarded from the hand in 2 ways;
 # Being used in Suppression Fire or player Attacks
 # Reloading / Dropping Weapon

For 1, the cards are discarded to a discard pile, and when the main ammo deck is depleted this is re-shuffled and used as the new Ammo Deck

For 2, the cards are placed back into the current Ammo Deck (which is re-shuffled), and new cards are drawn.
